Determining which factors keep employeees at an organisation and which prompt others to leave.There is a need to know the factors which can be changed to prevent the loss of good people,because the power of any organisation is in retaining their quality workforce.I had to build a binary machine learning classification model to find out,which factors led to employee attrition? I therefore trained my dataset using these three classification models:

**1. Logistic Regression algorithm.**
**2. KNN algorithm **
**2. Random Forest Classifier Algorithm.**
