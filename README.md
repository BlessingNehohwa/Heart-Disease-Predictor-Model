This notebook looks into using various python based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes. We're going to take the following approach or pipeline.

**1. Logistic Regression algorithm.**
**2. KNN algorithm.**
**3. Random Forest Classifier Algorithm.**
